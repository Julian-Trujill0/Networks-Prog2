I used the socket library in order to ensure that only 1 connection could be established at a time. Afterwards using the unistd.h library I created a struct that would be able to adapt to the custom headers that would be set by the client that would be sent to the server. The server then takes the values from the struct characteristics in order to react within the scope of the program. In order to ensure that there is no in proper values there is a helper function that in implemented to ensure that the flags are either 1 or 0 not an improper value.
